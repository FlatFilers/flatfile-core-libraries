  // How do you plan to handle ambiguous dates where it's not clear from the numbers the position of Day and Month values e.g. 2022-04-06? I get this question from prospects and don't have a clear answer since we rely on date-fns and I'm not sure the exact behavior.

  // That's a good question.  for this release I think we're best off sticking with ISO Date parsing.
  // in an upcoming release we will start adding cast options
  // as `cast:{args for cast function}` or `castArgs:{args for cast function}`

  // The longterm goal is to make this part of mapping.  Looking at a single date, you can't tell the order of month vs day, looking at a whole column, you can, the position that has values over 12 is the day column, that dictates your cast function.  This doesn't even require reading a model built off of all of our imports, it could be inferred from most single imports.  I'm sure @stephen has thoughts about this.  The cast function should have access to metatdata about the import, informed by mapping.
