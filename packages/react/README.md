# Embed React

Embed React is a front-end SDK wrapper around the [Flatfile API](https://flatfile.stoplight.io/docs/v10/). It allows you to securely and easily add an embedded import experience to any React app. Customization includes adding colors, logos, & fonts to match your brand.

You can use embedded Flatfile to receive data via a self-serve experience. To find the additional Flatfile integration paths that may work better for your business, explore our [docs](flatfile.stoplight.io).

### Before you begin

The minimum supported version of React is v18. If you use an older version, upgrade React to use this library. You will also need Node.js v18 installed on your machine.

### Get started
