        The @flatfile/listener package receives exciting new updates! An unmount() method has been added, allowing developers to cleanly disconnect the event listener from the event driver. This provides more control over the listener's lifecycle. Additionally, the EventDriver class now includes an unmountEventHandler() method to support removing attached event handlers. Developers can now effortlessly manage their event listeners, providing a smoother integration experience with Flatfile. These improvements showcase our commitment to delivering a robust and user-friendly event handling solution tailored to your needs. Upgrade to the latest version and unlock seamless event management capabilities!
