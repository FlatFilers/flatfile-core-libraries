        @flatfile/javascript@1.2.5

        This release brings some exciting new features to the @flatfile/javascript package! The startFlatfile function now accepts several new optional parameters, giving you greater control over the Flatfile experience within your application. You can now specify a namespace, metadata object, array of labels, translation path, and language override. These options allow you to better customize the embedded Flatfile to match your application's branding and localization needs. Additionally, the workbook configuration object passed to startFlatfile has been updated to accept the full CreateWorkbookConfig type, providing more flexibility in defining your workbook setup. For example, you can now pass in custom actions for each sheet. Finally, a bug related to updating the space configuration has been fixed, ensuring a smoother integration process. Upgrade to take advantage of these powerful new capabilities and improvements!
