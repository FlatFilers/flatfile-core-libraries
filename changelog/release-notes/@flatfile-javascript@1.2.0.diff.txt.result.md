        The new version 1.2.0 of the @flatfile/javascript package includes exciting updates that enhance its functionality and improve the developer experience. The package now utilizes nested entrypoints in the package.json file, allowing for more efficient module importing. Additionally, peer dependencies are now included in the JavaScript UMD build, ensuring better compatibility and reducing potential conflicts. 

        Furthermore, the package has updated its dependencies, with @flatfile/listener upgraded to version 1.0.0 and @flatfile/embedded-utils to version 1.1.9. These updates bring improved stability and bug fixes to the package.

        One notable change is the inclusion of a temporary workaround for an issue in the @flatfile/plugin-record-hook package, which will be addressed in a future release. This change ensures smoother integration and functionality for developers using the @flatfile/javascript package.

        Developers can now enjoy a streamlined and optimized experience when working with this package, thanks to the improved module structure, dependency management, and compatibility enhancements. Upgrade to version 1.2.0 today and take advantage of these exciting new features!
