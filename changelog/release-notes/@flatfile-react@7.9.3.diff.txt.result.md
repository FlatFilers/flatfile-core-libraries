        This release updates the @flatfile/react package, making some properties of the closeSpace configuration optional. The closeSpace.operation and closeSpace.onClose properties are now optional, allowing more flexibility when configuring the closing behavior of the Flatfile import experience. Additionally, it updates the @flatfile/embedded-utils dependency to version 1.2.1. The changes also include improvements to event handling and cleanup, ensuring a smoother integration with the Flatfile import experience. Exciting new features that make it even easier for developers to integrate Flatfile's powerful data import capabilities into their applications!
