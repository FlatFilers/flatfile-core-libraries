        @flatfile/javascript@1.2.1

        In this release of the @flatfile/javascript package, version 1.2.1, there is an update to the types for better compatibility with the @flatfile/plugin-record-hook plugin. Developers using this package will no longer need to suppress TypeScript type errors when using the recordHook function. This improvement enhances the developer experience by providing more accurate type information and reducing the need for type workarounds. Additionally, the @flatfile/plugin-record-hook dependency has been updated to version 1.4.0, which likely includes the type fixes mentioned. This release demonstrates Flatfile's commitment to providing a seamless integration experience for developers, with robust type support and compatibility across their ecosystem of packages.
