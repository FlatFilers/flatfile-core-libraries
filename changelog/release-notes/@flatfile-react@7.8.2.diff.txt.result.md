        @flatfile/react@7.8.2

        The latest version 7.8.2 of the @flatfile/react package brings exciting updates that make it even easier for developers to seamlessly integrate Flatfile's powerful data import experience into their applications!

        The main change is the addition of exports and browser fields in the package.json file, allowing for more flexible and optimized module resolution. The exports field specifies how to import the package in different environments, while the browser field enables seamless usage in browser environments.

        Additionally, the package now supports both CommonJS (require) and ES Module (import) formats, making it compatible with a wide range of bundlers and build tools.

        To enhance the developer experience further, the package structure has been streamlined. The main entry point has been moved to src/index.ts, and the unnecessary index.ts file in the package root has been removed.

        Finally, this release includes dependency updates, ensuring compatibility with the latest versions of other Flatfile packages.

        Overall, these improvements make the @flatfile/react package more robust, efficient, and developer-friendly, further simplifying the process of integrating Flatfile's exceptional data import capabilities into your application.
