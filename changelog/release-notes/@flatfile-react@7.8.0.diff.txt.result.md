        @flatfile/react@7.8.0

        This is a major new release for the @flatfile/react package! Developers can now effortlessly customize the look and feel of the Flatfile import experience with new theming capabilities. The `<PDFViewer/>` component has been enhanced to support additional customizations, including the ability to adjust the toolbar color and add a custom logo. Additionally, a new `onChangeRequest` prop has been introduced to the `<ImportManager/>` component, allowing developers to handle change requests from users more effectively. For example, `<ImportManager onChangeRequest={(request) => handleChangeRequest(request)} />` grants access to the change request object, enabling better control over the import process. This release empowers developers to tailor the data import experience to their application's unique branding and functionality requirements.
