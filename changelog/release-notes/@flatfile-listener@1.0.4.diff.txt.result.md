        @flatfile/listener@1.0.4

        The @flatfile/listener package has received a few updates in the latest release. The build tooling has been optimized for faster builds. Additionally, the package dependencies have been updated to their latest versions. One notable change is the peer dependency on @flatfile/api has been bumped to version 1.8.5, which developers using this package should be aware of and update accordingly. The rollup build configuration has also been streamlined by removing the need for the TypeScript plugin and replacing it with the newer @rollup/plugin-sucrase which handles TypeScript transformations more efficiently. These improvements will provide a better developer experience when working with the @flatfile/listener package by speeding up builds and ensuring compatibility with the latest dependencies. Overall, these changes demonstrate a commitment to optimizing the package for performance and keeping it up-to-date with the latest tooling and dependencies.
