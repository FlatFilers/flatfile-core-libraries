        In this release, the @flatfile/react package introduces updates to the initialization parameters for the embedded wrapper. The changes allow developers to provide additional configurations when creating a new space, such as namespace, labels, translation paths, language overrides, and metadata. This enhanced flexibility enables a more customized experience tailored to the application's needs. Additionally, the update includes optimizations to the space creation process, streamlining the workflow for cases where a pre-existing workbook is not provided. Developers can now seamlessly create spaces with or without workbooks, ensuring a smooth onboarding experience. These improvements empower developers to integrate Flatfile's data import capabilities more effectively, aligning with their specific requirements and delivering an optimized user experience.
